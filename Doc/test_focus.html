<!-- This is a guide for what to look for in Google Photos DOM -->
<!-- The image viewer typically has these elements:
  - A role="main" region that contains the viewer
  - An [aria-label] or class that identifies it as the viewer
  - A container with data-has-scrollable or similar
  - The actual IMG tag inside, but that changes frequently
  
The key is to focus something STABLE like the viewer container, not the image itself.
Google Photos shortcuts (j/k) work on the viewer container, not individual elements.
